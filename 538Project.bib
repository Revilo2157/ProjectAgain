  abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper we introduce a statistical quality model for delay testing that reflects fabrication process quality, design delay margin, and test timing accuracy. The model provides a measure that predicts the chip defect level that cause delay failure, including marginal small delay. We can therefore use the model to make test vectors that are effective in terms of both testing cost and chip quality. The results of experiments using ISCAS89 benchmark data and some large industrial design data reflect various characteristics of our statistical delay quality model. key words: delay testing, quality model, defect distribution 1.},

  abstract = {Interconnect-based defects such as partial opens are becoming more prevalent in nanoscale designs. These are latent defects that affect circuit reliability and can be modeled as small-delay defects. Detecting such defects therefore requires faster than at-speed test clocks. In the paper we analyze the uncertainty introduced by process variations in detecting these defects. We propose new path selection algorithms that increase the probability of defect detection by taking into account the variability in path delays. Our results show that the new technique detects much smaller defects than the traditional approach of selecting the longest paths for test.},
